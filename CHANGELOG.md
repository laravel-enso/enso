### Upgrade steps
* run `composer update` in the project's root
* run the upgrade commands (both regular and `before-migration`) to ensure
  database & strucure is up to date, since this release cleans up a lot of package upgrades
* upgrade your machine to php8
* in `composer.json` update  the following dependencies to the given versions:
    -  `"laravel-enso/core": "^7.0",`
    -  `"sentry/sentry-laravel": "^2.0.0"`
    -  `"laravel-enso/phpunit-pretty-print": "^1.0",`
    -  `"nunomaduro/phpinsights": "^2.0",`
* search & replace in your local project (including the database folder) the following namespaces:
    - `Core\Models\UserGroup` -> `UserGroups\Models\UserGroup`
    - `Core\Enums\UserGroups` -> `UserGroups\Enums\UserGroups`
    - `Core\\Enums\\UserGroups` -> `UserGroups\\Enums\\UserGroups`
    - `Core\Models\User` -> `Users\Models\User`
    - `Core\Policies\User` -> `Users\Policies\User`
    - `Core\Models\Session` -> `Users\Models\Session`
    - `Core\Http\Controllers\Administration\Users` -> `Users\Http\Controllers`
    - `Core\Http\Controllers\Administration\UserGroups` -> `UserGroups\Http\Controllers`
    - `Core\Tables\Administration\Users` -> `Users\Tabels`
    - `Core\Forms\Administration\Users` -> `Users\Forms`
    - `Core\Http\Resources\User` -> `Users\Http\Resources\User`
    - `Core\\Http\\Resources\\User` -> `Users\\Http\\Resources\\User`
    - `Core\Http\Requests\ValidateUserRequest` -> `Users\Http\Requests\ValidateUserRequest`
    - `Core\Database\Factories\UserFactory` -> `Users\Database\Factories\UserFactory`
    - `Core\Database\Seeders\UserGroupSeeder` -> `UserGroups\Database\Seeders\UserGroupSeeder`
    - `Core\Database\Seeders\UserSeeder` -> `Users\Database\Seeders\UserSeeder`
- remove from `config/insights.php` the deprecated:
```
use ObjectCalisthenics\Sniffs\Files\FunctionLengthSniff;
use ObjectCalisthenics\Sniffs\Metrics\MethodPerClassLimitSniff;
use ObjectCalisthenics\Sniffs\NamingConventions\ElementNameMinimalLengthSniff;
```
* run `composer update` in the project's root
- update any local person/people factories and seeders and remove the `title` attribute as it has been dropped
- for your local imports, for the importer & validator classes, update the following method signatures (& logic where necessary):
    - run: `public function run(Obj $row, DataImport $import);`
    - after: `public function after(DataImport $import);`
    - authorizes: `public function authorizes(DataImport $import): bool;`
    - before: `public function before(DataImport $import);`
* for your local table JSON templates, change any `money` keys to `number`, and remove any "thousand" & "decimal" attributes. Number supports `precision`, `symbol` and `template` (e.g. "%v %s" - `%v` for value, `%s` for symbol)
* local `storage/app/.gitignore` should be updated to ignore all and look like this
    ```
    *
    !.gitignore
    ```
  You may also remove `.gitignore` files from individual enso created, app sub-folders (except `public`)
* check the local `config/enso/tables.php` file and if the `export.path` key is present, update it to `export.folder`
* local state:
    - remove the local state binding from `App\Providers\AppServiceProvider`: `CoreLocalState::class => LocalState::class,`
    - remove the `App\Services\LocalState` class after moving any logic to one or more state builder services
    - from `client/src/js/enso.js`, remove the import: `import './localState';`
    - remove the file `client/src/js/localState.js`
    - if you moved logic from the old `LocalState` class, update the file `client/src/js/store/local.js` as required, otherwise you may delete it. Note that the `client/src/js/store` folder MUST be present.
* compare `config/enso/config.php` with `vendor/laravel-enso/core/config/config.php`
  and remove any extra, deprecated keys
* still in `config/enso/config.php` update the Enso version to 4.8.0
* compare `config/enso/addresses.php` with `vendor/laravel-enso/addresses/config/addresses.php` and remove any extra, deprecated keys
* update the `password` `config/enso/auth.php` key as follows:
    ```
    'password' => [
            'lifetime' => env('PASSWORD_LIFETIME', 0),
            'minLength' => env('PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH', 6),
            'mixedCase' => (bool) env('PASSWORD_MIXED_CASE', 0),
            'numeric' => (bool) env('PASSWORD_NUMERIC', 0),
            'special' => (bool) env('PASSWORD_SPECIAL', 0),
    ],
    ```
* from `Database\Seeders\DatabaseSeeder`, from the `run()` method's unit tests running branch, you may delete the following seeders, as the respective factories have been updated to no longer require this:
    ```
                CountrySeeder::class,
                RegionSeeder::class,
                TownshipSeeder::class,
                LocalitySeeder::class,
    ```
* update/rename the following `.env` variables:
    - `PASSWORD_LENGTH` -> `PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH`
    - `PASSWORD_NUMERIC_CHARACTERS` -> `PASSWORD_NUMERIC`
    - `PASSWORD_SPECIAL_CHARACTERS` -> `PASSWORD_SPECIAL`
    - `PASSWORD_UPPER_CASE_CHARACTERS` -> `PASSWORD_MIXED_CASE`
* replace `LaravelEnso\Core\Exceptions\Sentry` usage and import with `LaravelEnso\Sentry\Exceptions\Handler` in `App\Exceptions\Handler.php`
* remove `bulma-rtl` patch from `client\patches`, as is no longer needed
* run `yarn`, `yarn upgrade && yarn` in `/client` to ensure you have the latest versions and patches are applied. If necessary, update your patches
* `php artisan migrate`
* `php artisan enso:upgrade`
* as per every release, delete any local, deprecated upgrades
* it recommended to also run the all the enso tests to make everything is working properly; therefore, compare your local `phpunit.xml` with Enso's and make sure that you're not missing any package tests.

### Upgrade steps

Although this release contains breaking changes, unless you've been getting deep into the framework, there are high chances these will not affect you.

A files upgrade is included and should run together with any other relevant upgrades, but before running it please read all the notes below.

To upgrade:
- run `composer update`
- run `yarn`, `yarn upgrade && yarn` to ensure you have the latest package versions and patches are applied. If necessary, update your patch files
- `composer dump-autoload`
- `php artisan enso:upgrade --before-migration`
- `php artisan migrate`
- `php artisan enso:upgrade`
- as per every release, delete any local, old upgrades
- if using the `calendar` package, you should remove the scheduling of the  `enso:calendar:send-reminders` local command as it's being scheduled from within the package
- if using the `data-export` package, you should remove the scheduling of the  `enso:data-export:purge` local command as it's being scheduled from within the package
- for table exports, data-import & data-exports templates may have changed slightly, if using internationalized texts, you may need to update your translations
- phpunit configuration has become more strict so ensure you have the proper path defided for the following packages:
    - `helpers`:
  ```xml
  <directory suffix="Test.php">./vendor/laravel-enso/helpers/tests/unit</directory>
  ```
    - `cnpvalidator`/`cnp-validator`:
  ```xml
  <directory suffix="Test.php">./vendor/laravel-enso/cnp-validator/tests/features</directory>
  ```
    - `menu-manager`/`menus`:
  ```xml
  <directory suffix="Test.php">./vendor/laravel-enso/menus/tests/features</directory>
  ```

#### if running data imports programmatically
- previously you had to create an `UploadedFile` instance, then pass it to the `Import` service:
    ```php
    $file = new UploadedFile(Storage::path($path), $filename, null, null, true);
    (new Import(self::Type, $file))->handle();
    ```

- now, you should use the `DataImport->attach()` method and pass the storage relative  path to the file and the filename:
    ```php
    DataImport::factory()->make(['type' => self::Type])->attach($path, $filename);
    ```

#### if generating exports using the `data-export` package
- the `ExportsExcel` contract has been updated to support generating multiple sheets:
    ```php
    public function heading(): array
    ```
  becomes
    ```php
    public function heading(string $sheet): array
    ```
    ```php
    public function query(): Builder
    ```
  becomes
    ```php
    public function rows(string $sheet): array
    ````
    ```php
    public function attributes(): array
    ```
  becomes
    ```php
    public function sheets(): array
    ```
    ```php
    public function mapping($row): array
    ```
  becomes
    ```php
    public function mapping($call): array
    ```
- the previous `BeforeExportHook' & `AfterExportHook` contracts have been renamed to `BeforeHook` & `AfterHook` respectively, and allow you to add specific logic before & after running the export as before
- by default, the user running the export is notified upon the export's completion
- there is a new `Notifies` contract that allows you to replace the default notification logic, which you may also use to disable notifications
- if previously, you were handling notifications for exports, consider using the out-of-the-box functionality and remove the notification logic
- on the exporter, you may optionally add a `public function emailSubject(): string` method and return a custom subject for the email notification
- on the exporter, you may optionally add a `public function notifiables(DataExport $export): Collection` method, which should return an array of notifiable entities, that receive the export done notification
- previously, when creating an export, you had to create a DataExport model, the exporter class, instantiate the ExcelExport service, and the call its handle method:
    ```php
    $exporter = new MyExporter();
    $dataExport = DataExport::create([
        'name' => $exporter->filename(),
        'entries' => 0,
        'created_by' => $user->id,
    ]);

    (new ExcelExport($user, $dataExport, $exporter))->handle();

    return $dataExport->download();
    ```
- now, you may call the static `excel(...)` method on the `DataExport` model
    ```php
    $exporter = new MyExporter();

    return DataExport::excel($exporter)->file->inline();
    ```
- if running exports programmatically or from jobs, authenticate using the required user before running the export:
    ```php
    Auth::setUser($this->user);
    ```

#### if working locally with files, or models that work with files

The following Enso models use the `HasFile` trait: `Avatar`, `Brand`, `CarouselSlide`, `Company`, `DataExport`, `DataImport`, `Document`, `Picture`, `Poster`, `RejectedImport`, `Upload`, `Video`, `WebshopPage`.

- the included [FilePath](https://github.com/laravel-enso/files/blob/master/src/Upgrades/FilePath.php) upgrade will handle the update of files attached to Enso models (such as those above).

  However, the `Attachable` contract in concert with the `HasFile` trait allows an attachable model to specify a potentially dynamic folder name where to store files.

  **IF** you are using this flow for your own local models, you need to handle upgrade for those file records yourself.

- the `HasFile` trait has been updated and no longer cascades the following methods:
    - `inline`
    - `download`
    - `temporaryLink`
    - `attach`
    - `upload`
    - `folder`

    What this means is that you should load the file and chain/call the desired method on the file model:
      ```php
      $document->file->download();
      ```
- the `storagePath()` method has been removed, both from the trait and the File model. You should use instead:
    ```php
    Storage::path($document->file->path);
    ```
- the `LaravelEnso\Files\Traits/Uploads.php` has been removed
- previously, when using the `attach(...)` method on the `File` model or the any `Attachable` model, through the `HasFile` proxy method with the same name, the file was being optimized. If you are attaching files that somehow do not come through the Enso flow, handle any needed optimization manually.
- the `file` relationship as defined in the [HasFile](https://github.com/laravel-enso/files/blob/master/src/Traits/HasFile.php) provides a default if no file exists:
    ```php
    public function file(): Relation
        {
            return $this->morphOne(File::class, 'attachable')
                ->withDefault();
        }
    ```

  Update any checks using truthy logic such as `if ($myAttachableModel->file) {...}` as required, or you may have unexpected consequences.

### Upgrade steps

As this new release cleaned up the `@enso-ui/ui` package and simplified icon and route
registration, a bit of cleanup is also required in the local project.

Also, a new `php artisan enso:upgrade --before-migration` command is available that
is meant be used to run upgrade commands **before** the `php artisan migrate` command,
which should help with complex upgrade scenarios.


To upgrade:
- within `client/.env` the following entry must be added:
    - `VUE_APP_PROFILE=bulma`
    The `.env` file must also be available during the build stage,
    so take that into account if using CI flows.
- the `@core` alias has been renamed to `@ui`, so update all usages, including
    - local resources (pages, components)
    - the `client/.eslintrc.js` file
- bump at least the following dependencies within `client\package.json`:
    - `"@enso-ui/activity-log": "^3.0`
    - `"@enso-ui/bulma": "^4.0",`
    - `"@enso-ui/calendar": "^3.0",`
    - `"@enso-ui/data-import": "^3.0",`

    - `"eslint-config-airbnb-base": "14.2.0",`
    Depending on your project requirement, the following dependencies might also need bumping:
    - `"@enso-ui/categories": "^2.0",`
    - `"@enso-ui/commercial": "^4.0",`
    - `"@enso-ui/discounts": "^3.0",`

    - `"@enso-ui/products": "^3.0",`
    - `"@enso-ui/services": "^3.0",`
    - `"@enso-ui/themes": "^2.0",`
- remove any package icon imports from `client/src/js/app.js`, as they're no longer required
- if using the dashboard page/component & menu, import the menu icon in `client/src/js/app.js`:
    ```
    import { library } from '@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core';
    import { faTachometerAlt } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons';
    library.add(faTachometerAlt);
    ```
- unless using them in your local resources, you may remove package aliases from `client/vue.config.js`
- the avatar (`Avatar.vue`) component has been moved from the `ui` package to the `users` package, if you're using it locally, update the imports.
- within the `composer.json` `scripts/post-update-cmd` section add the command:
    - `"php artisan enso:upgrade:status"`
- the `data-import` package has been made optional, if you still require it, add it to:
    - `composer.json` : `"laravel-enso/data-import": "^5.0",`
    - `package.json`: `"@enso-ui/data-import": "^3.0",`
- the `tasks` package has been made optional, if you added it & still require it, add it to:
    - `composer.json` : `"laravel-enso/tasks": "^1.0",`
    - `package.json`: `"@enso-ui/tasks": "^2.0",`
- remove the following files as they're no longer required:
    - `client/src/js/store.js`
    - `client/src/js/router.js`
- look within this [PR](https://github.com/laravel-enso/enso/pull/344/files) and update:
    - `client/src/js/enso.js`
    - `client/src/js/localState.js`
- run `composer update`
- run `yarn`, `yarn upgrade && yarn` to ensure you have the latest package versions and patches are applied. If necessary, update your patch files
- `php artisan migrate`
- `composer dump-autoload`
- `php artisan enso:upgrade`
- publish the updated localisation assets with `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=enso-localisation`
and copy the `ru.json` file from the above commit into the local `resources/lang/app` folder
- in `Envoyer` and/or during your deployment process, add the new command:
    `php artisan enso:upgrade --before-migration`
- update the Enso version to `4.4.0` in `config/enso/config.php`
- as per every release, delete the old upgrades

## 4.3.0

This release aims to upgrade the Enso ecosystem to [Laravel 8](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/releases#laravel-8).

### Front-end

#### select
- the api request payload was cleaned up and null values are no longer sent to the back-end

### Back-end

Where necessary, packages have been updated to add Laravel 8 compatibility. Changes affect:
- factories
- seeders
- routes (now using imported controller classes instead of strings & namespaces)
- tests
- upgrades (older upgrades were deleted)
- dependencies versions

Where possible, we've kept packages backwards compatible.

#### logs
- fixes multiple log file types edge case bug

#### products
- removed default supplier limitation, where previously the default supplier had to have the lowest aquisition price

#### forms
- added support for the `searchMode` meta attribute, which can be used for select fields

### Upgrade steps

First and foremost, be sure the to read the official [Laravel 8 upgrade guide](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/upgrade) to understand all implications.

Since we liked the previous flow of publishing factories and customizing them, we've created a `FactoryResolver` class that is used to emulate the old behavior. Basically, when using a factory to create a model, we first search in the local project factories folder and try to find a suitable factory class, otherwise we search for a factory in the factories folder in the laravel-enso package which contains the respective model.

The limitation for the factory naming convention is that if you have two models with the same name, with different namespaces, you'll need to customize the models' `newFactory()` method and implement your own strategy.

Also, note that starting with this release we're no longer doing a yarn legacy build (only modern) so please take a look at `package.json` & `babel.config.js` and update if necessary.

To upgrade:
- within `composer.json`
    - update the versions for the following `require` packages
    ```
    "fruitcake/laravel-cors": "^2.0",
    "guzzlehttp/guzzle": "^7.0.1",
    "laravel-enso/core": "^6.0",
    "laravel/horizon": "^5.0",
    "laravel/telescope": "^4.0",
    "laravel/ui": "^3.0",
    ```
    - update the versions for the following `require-dev` packages
    ```
    "facade/ignition": "^2.3.6",
    "nunomaduro/collision": "^5.0",
    "phpunit/phpunit": "^9.3"
    ```
    - add the following namespaces to the `autoload/psr-4` section:
    ```
    "Database\\Factories\\": "database/factories/",
    "Database\\Seeders\\": "database/seeders/"
    ```
    - remove the `classmap` block and its contents from the `autoload` section
- **update where necessary** by following this [merge request](https://github.com/laravel-enso/enso/pull/338) for a list of other updated files  (local factories and seeders cleanup, config files and more).
- run `composer update`
- run `yarn`, `yarn upgrade && yarn` to ensure you have the latest package versions and patches are applied. If necessary, update your patch files
- `php artisan migrate`
- `composer dump-autoload`
- `php artisan enso:upgrade`
- update the Enso version to `4.3.0` in `config/enso/config.php`

Remember:
- you can delete any non customized local seeders and import them from their package
- update factories & seeders to
    - use namespaces
    - convert to classes
    - rename the 'seeds' folder to 'seeders'
- update models with factories and add the new trait `HasFactory`
- update tests to
    - use the new factories
    - refactor around the deprecated json methods
- update routes by importing controllers as per the new syntax
- after updating your routes by importing the controller classes, you need to remove the `protected $namespace = 'App\Http\Controllers';` line in `RouteServiceProvider`

## 4.0.0
With this release we added sanctum to our core, opening the way for mobile applications and better integrations with external apis. We have also refactored all of our backend packages. Among the changes we have brought to our backend code, we have managed to:

- remove `App` namespace from our backend packages. We started with our left foot regarding this when we split Enso into specialized packages and we carried the bad decision along the way. It was time to revert this
- add typed properties to Structure Migrations
- gave up using `fillable` in our models in favour of  `$guarded = ['id']`
- many other punctual improvements and bug fixes which further hone our ecosystem.
- remove how-to, activity-log, tutorials, comments, documents, discussions as core dependencies. Made cli as dev-dependency
- move helpers from classes to services
- update the docker image

Since we consider that Enso has matured enough, starting with 4.0.0 we are going to use [semver](https://semver.org/). As a result, we have updated all package dependencies and incremented the major version where the case.

### front-end

Most of the packages received a dependency list update.
For all packages, we've refactored the `modal` uses according to its latest version by dropping the `show` control property.

# upgrades steps
### Backend
1. update dependencies to next major for example core ^5.0 (like [this](https://github.com/laravel-enso/enso/blob/6d98e9348bd79f203e1edcbd40732d70e083278a/composer.json))
2. run `composer update`
3. add `SANCTUM_STATEFUL_DOMAINS ` to .env (like [this](https://github.com/laravel-enso/enso/pull/316/files#diff-cbfd64a28982a1818f2b5f16e7f9d634R68))
4. remove App from namespace of packages,(you can use this regex, `LaravelEnso\\(.*)\\App\\` replace with `LaravelEnso\\$1\\`)
    - you need to replace `laravel-enso/(.*)/src/App/` with `laravel-enso/$1/src/` too
5. `Comments`, `Discussions` & `Replies` traits were removed and you need remove them from `User.php` (like [this](https://github.com/laravel-enso/enso/pull/316/files#diff-4614b2d052a2cb7486640775e2bdbb55R2-R9))
6. run `composer dump-autoload`
7. you need to add the `AuthorizationCookie` and `EnsureFrontendRequestsAreStateful` middleware classes to middleware group (like [this](https://github.com/laravel-enso/enso/blob/f0fedbab000035b9b998290c1fd2d2af1e038e0f/app/Http/Kernel.php))
8. if you didn't bind Core/User to the local User, you need to do this now in `AppServiceProvider` (like [this](https://github.com/laravel-enso/enso/pull/316/files#diff-80bda0ca3af455d6354e095203e0199aR11-R14) )
9. you need to replace the `web` middleware with `api` in `RouteServiceProvider.php` and in your local `api.php` routes (like [this](https://github.com/laravel-enso/enso/pull/316/files#diff-b467cc786635bd6945b17726282f1c64R28-R34))
10. you must update the configuration values for defaults.guard to `api` and api.driver to `sanctum` (like [this](https://github.com/laravel-enso/enso/pull/316/files#diff-3fc9d8e570780c4eb337c6f860b1e8e0))
11. we have replaced the `fillable` property with `guarded` on all of our models, so make sure to update the local models accordingly
12. the `CompanyStatuses` enum was renamed to `Statuses`
13. you need to add types to `LaravelEnso/Migrator` `Migration` class fields (like [this](https://github.com/laravel-enso/enso/pull/316/files#diff-9c0e569dfec04dd81a69d88cde76a0ef))
14. you may need to fix routes in imports and static files (like [this](https://github.com/laravel-enso/enso/pull/316/files#diff-2e0b85f74baf44e5614b951a9b21056bR100)) (you can use this pattern for searching `laravel-enso/.*/src/database`)
15. publish the sanctum config `php artisan vendor:publish  --tag=sanctum-config`
16. publish the monitoring seeder `php artisan vendor:publish  --tag=control-panel-api-seeder` (optional, if you’re using Control Panel Api)
17. add `Broadcast::routes(['middleware' => ['auth:sanctum']]);` to `routes/api.php`(like [this](https://github.com/laravel-enso/enso/pull/316/files#diff-27c5e06ed9d12656d283f7d0c76b49bdR1-R32))
18. search & replace `use LaravelEnso\Helpers\Classes\` with `use LaravelEnso\Helpers\Services\`
19. `companies` doesn't have `documents`, `comments`, `discussion` as dependencies anymore, if you still need them you need to install them and using `DynamicMethod` (like [dynamic-methods](https://github.com/laravel-enso/enso/tree/cf58505cec80bdc49003c0ea11d3837a60fbb4e9/app/DynamicRelations), [AppServiceProvider.php](https://github.com/laravel-enso/enso/pull/316/files#diff-80bda0ca3af455d6354e095203e0199aR16-R28), [composer.json](https://github.com/laravel-enso/enso/pull/316/files#diff-b5d0ee8c97c7abd7e3fa29b9a27d1780))
20. `how-to`, `activity-log` & `tutorials` were removed from the `laravel-enso/core`, therefore if you need to use them you need install too (like [this](https://github.com/laravel-enso/enso/blob/6d98e9348bd79f203e1edcbd40732d70e083278a/composer.json))
21. `obs` field was replaced with `notes`, you need to update migrations and factories regarding this change
22. replace the deprecated `defaultAddress()` method with `address` where necessary
23. publish the telescope assets by running `php artisan telescope:publish`
24. publish the horizon assets by running `php artisan horizon:publish`
25. update version `4.0.0`

### FrontEnd:
1. update dependencies to the next major version (for example `"@enso-ui/ui": "^3.0"`) except (`clipboard`, `confirmation`, `datepicker`, `directives`, `divider`, `dropdown-indicator`, `enums`, `erd`, `laravel-validation`, `money`, `progress-bar`, `progress-circle`, `route-mapper`, `strings`, `switch`, `tabs`, `textarea`, `themes`, `transitions`, `wysiwyg`, `uploader`) (like [this](https://github.com/laravel-enso/enso/blob/6d98e9348bd79f203e1edcbd40732d70e083278a/client/package.json))
2. run `yarn`, `yarn upgrade && yarn` to ensure you have the latest versions and patches are applied. If necessary, update your patch files
3. remove the `eslintrc.js` file from the project root
4. remove `App` from namespace of packages (you can use this regex, search for `LaravelEnso\\(.*)\\App\\` and replace with `LaravelEnso\\$1\\`)
5. `how-to`, `activity-log`, `tutorials` were removed from the `enso-ui/ui`, therefore if you need to use them you should install the packages and set them up (you can look at [.eslintrc.js](https://github.com/laravel-enso/enso/blob/cf58505cec80bdc49003c0ea11d3837a60fbb4e9/client/.eslintrc.js), [app.js](https://github.com/laravel-enso/enso/blob/cf58505cec80bdc49003c0ea11d3837a60fbb4e9/client/src/js/app.js), [vue.config.js](https://github.com/laravel-enso/enso/blob/cf58505cec80bdc49003c0ea11d3837a60fbb4e9/client/vue.config.js), [router.js](https://github.com/laravel-enso/enso/blob/cf58505cec80bdc49003c0ea11d3837a60fbb4e9/client/src/js/router.js))
6. `companies` doesn't depend on `documents`, `comments` or `discussion` anymore, if you still need them you can use patch (like [this](https://github.com/laravel-enso/enso/blob/5ea9ba20f63865105acd13c65838f79de9ac860a/client/patches/%40enso-ui%2Bcompanies%2B2.0.1.patch))
7. toastr was changed in this version, and you need to inject it wherever you need(like [this](https://github.com/enso-ui/forms/commit/51020d02320ff184dab1fda9b5e08eee310fcc65#diff-430b1af0e264e06ed63092d6452b76f5R36-R178)) (it's optional but recommended)
8. modal was changed and the :show property has been removed, you need to use v-if instead of :show (like [this](https://github.com/enso-ui/files/commit/e167a81b5743444c2466228db7f5bbd329efb49b#diff-19fdd3d0be7c460814ca0301e0d0c61aR1-R5) and [this](https://github.com/enso-ui/companies/commit/7d016b35ea2f580ccc035196eba5f1196183f889#diff-4cdb1f903fa4351c4fa1a92c10489760R61-R68))
9. `documents`, `comments`, `addresses` & `discussions` were extracted from `Accessories` therefore if you need them you can import them from `@enso-ui/bulma` instead of `@enso-ui/accessories` (like [this](https://github.com/enso-ui/people/pull/8/files#diff-255683f769d6397e63c0976349f1204cR70-R72))

### Upgrade steps

To upgrade:
- run `composer update` in the project's root
- run `yarn`, `yarn upgrade && yarn` to ensure you have the latest versions and patches are applied. If necessary, update your patches
- update the Enso version to 3.9.4 in `config/enso/config.php`
- if using the `MapsRequestKeys` trait, within the respective request validators, update the controllers to use `$request->validated()` instead of `$request->mapped()`
- for all the enso models that use the `Addressable`, `Commentable`, `Discussable`, `Documentable` traits, we are now using `Relation::morphMap(...)`
and short keys instead of default namespaces as this solves issues with relationships breaking when extending models which use `morph` relationships.
For consistency, you should do the same to your local models (you may look at the Company model & companies AppServiceProvider classes as example)
- the `files` test folder config key has been updated from `enso.files.paths.testing` to `enso.files.testingFolder`. If you are customizing the value, make sure to update the config file structure. Also make sure to update the local file after the one in the files package.
- if using the `products` package, note that the validator's `validateUnicity` method has been renamed to `validateUniqueness` - update your local validator if required
- for this release, we've switched from using predis to using phpredis. Ensure that:
    - the phpredis extension is installed on your (live) machines
    - the `redis.client` configuration option is set to `phpredis` in your `config/database.php`
    - if present in your env, the `REDIS_CLIENT` key value is `phpredis`
    - remove the `predis` package from your `composer.json`
- we've consolidated some assets (picture) locations and simplified the build process. You should:
    - run the `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=core-assets` command
    - cleanup the multiple `CopyPlugin` instances and keep just the command that copies assets from `../resources/images` to `images`. Use enso's `vue.config.js` file as an example
- the `VatRates` enum was removed from the `financials` & `products` packages and put in the `helpers` package. If using it locally, update the namespace to `LaravelEnso\Helpers\App\Enums\VatRates`
- the localisation package and flow has been enhanced. To update for the new flow do the following:
    - remove the `enso` resource directory from local language resources. From now on, when merging translations the core translations will be taken directly from the package resources
    - run `php artisan vendor:publish --force --tag=enso-localisation`
    - remove from your local `composer.json` file `"php artisan vendor:publish --tag=localisation-lang-files"` from under the `post-update-cmd` section
- since the email theme assets were updated, if you want to use the refreshed theme, you should publish the assets with `php artisan vendor:publish --force --tag=enso-email`
- the addresses package has been refactored and updated. You should:
    - publish the package seeders with `php artisan vendor:publish --force --tag=addresses-seeds`
    - publish the `AddressFactory.php` file with `php artisan vendor:publish --force --tag=addresses-factory`
    - if present, delete the local `RoAddress` factory from the factories folder
    - if using the `addresses` package WITHOUT the `ro-addresses` extension, make sure that the `php artisan enso:upgrade` command is run AFTER `php artisan migrate`
    - if using the `addresses` package WITH the `ro-addresses` extension, make sure that the `php artisan enso:upgrade` command is run BEFORE `php artisan migrate`
    - update the local/published `addresses` config file using the package version as reference
    - since there are some new addresses routes added, please ensure that the roles/permissions are correctly configured for your projects and then save the roles configurations
- run `php artisan enso:upgrade` considering the mentions above (in the addresses section)

### The new tables filters

While the new minimum configuration table filters are implemented and you may test drive them (by adding the `"filterable"` attribute in the table columns' meta arrays, and then configuring the filters from the table's UI), please note that some of the filters configuration options/values/structure may change. We therefore don't recommend using them just yet in production.

When this feature will reach what we consider a stable form, the various options will be explained and the documentation updated.

### Upgrade steps

To upgrade:
- remove from `client/package.json`:
    - extract-text-webpack-plugin
    - popper.js
    - postcss-cssnext
- add in client/package.json
    - postcss-preset-env
- run `composer require --dev laravel-enso/phpunit-pretty-print
- add in `phpunit.xml` `printerClass="LaravelEnso\PHPUnitPrettyPrint\PrettyPrint"`
- run `composer update` in the project's root
- run `yarn && yarn upgrade && yarn` to ensure you have the latest versions and patches are applied. If necessary, update your patches
- update the Enso version to 3.9.2 in `config/enso/config.php`
- in `config/enso/tables.php` update the `comparisonOperator` and `searchModes` keys to:
```php
'comparisonOperator' => ComparisonOperators::Like,
'searchModes' => [
    SearchModes::Full, SearchModes::StartsWith, SearchModes::EndsWith,
    SearchModes::ExactMatch, SearchModes::DoesntContain,
],
```
- in `config/enso/select.php` update the `comparisonOperator` and `searchMode` keys to:
```php
'comparisonOperator' => ComparisonOperators::Like,
'searchMode' => SearchModes::Full,
```
- in `config/enso/imports.php`:
    - add the new companies importer under the `configs` array
    ```php
    'companies' => [
        'label' => 'Companies',
        'template' => 'vendor/laravel-enso/companies/src/App/Imports/Templates/companies.json',
    ],
    ```
    - update `app` namespace to `App` for userGroups' importer
- update `resources/preferences.json` and change the `expandedMenu` key to `expandedSidebar`
- if using the `products` package:
    - add the `LaravelEnso\Products\App\Services\Upgrades\Products` upgrade service class to your upgrade logic and if customizing the validation/form, extending the model, ensure that the new attribute is fillable/etc as required
    - since products now depends on the `@enso-ui/categories` package, you should also import the package's icon and routes

### Upgrade steps

It was necessary to rename the `app` folders as with newer composer versions,
the tool would complain (show notices) about the namespace not being psr4 compliant.

If these notices were to be present when deploying, Envoyer would stop the deploy process.

However, since the namespaces remained the same, these changes should not affect you.

To upgrade:
- run `composer update` in the project's root
- run `yarn`, `yarn upgrade && yarn` to ensure you have the latest versions and patches are applied. If necessary, update your patches
- update the Enso version to 3.9.0 in `config/enso/config.php`
- if using the `ExcelExport` class locally, search & replace `LaravelEnso\Excel\App\Exports\ExcelExport` with `LaravelEnso\Excel\App\Services\ExcelExport`
- if directly using import templates from any of the Enso packages, update the path to the JSON templates in `config/enso/imports.php`


## 3.9.0

This release includes many improvements and new features, bugfixes as well as the upgrade to Laravel 7.*.

### Upgrade steps

- due to the upgrade to Laravel 7, there are quite a few small changes you have to do in your local project. Take a look at this [commit](https://github.com/laravel-enso/enso/commit/963af10ed4d794baf752219b303ddcd72451d22c) and check the list of changes. You should ignore:
   - `composer.lock`
   - `client/yarn.lock`
   - `.styleci.yaml`
   - `telescope` and `horizon` assets (you will publish these in the next steps)
- you may safely remove the `RAVEN_DSN` key from your `.env*` files as it's no longer required
- update `TelescopeServiceProvider` using [this](https://github.com/laravel-enso/enso/blob/c14d2d7a0c754ab8328171f9909d979e105ba832/app/Providers/TelescopeServiceProvider.php) as example
- update the sentry config file using [this](https://github.com/laravel-enso/enso/blob/c14d2d7a0c754ab8328171f9909d979e105ba832/config/sentry.php) as example
- run `composer update` in the project's root
- run `php artisan horizon:install`
- run `php artisan telescope:install`
- edit `client/package.json` and
    - update `@enso-ui/ui` to `2.5.x`
    - update `pusher-js` to `^5.0.0`
- rename in your .env* files `MAIL_DRIVER` to `MAIL_MAILER`
- run yarn, yarn upgrade && yarn to ensure you have the latest versions and patches are applied. If necessary, update your patches
- update the Enso version to 3.9.0 in `config/enso/config.php`
- run `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=select-config" to publish the `select.php` config
- note that the `type` attribute present in structure migrations has been deprecated and is no longer required - you may update your migrations, but it's not breaking if you leave it
- the database upgrade service has been refactored and extracted to its own package. If you have upgrade logic in your local project you may need to update it. You should use as an updated example the core upgrade [here](https://github.com/laravel-enso/core/tree/master/src/app/Services/Upgrades) and [here](https://github.com/laravel-enso/core/blob/master/src/app/Commands/Upgrade.php)
- update `config/cors.php` if your project requires it
- update local factories
- find any local `LaravelEnso\Helpers\App\Classes\JsonParser` usages and update to `LaravelEnso\Helpers\App\Classes\JsonReader`
- note that for Permission, the name should be unique; update the factory, look [here](https://github.com/laravel-enso/enso/blob/c14d2d7a0c754ab8328171f9909d979e105ba832/database/factories/PermissionFactory.php) for example
- update `App\Exceptions\Handler`, use [this](https://github.com/laravel-enso/enso/commit/1e8ad53994b230c2e5f65b7a82b41ad9b3570db0#diff-646a4842abf9023c975a9a1658a68b0a) as model
- make sure that in your composer.json you still have the following dependencies:
    - "doctrine/dbal": "^2.8",
    - "predis/predis": "^1.1",

### Upgrade steps:

- update sass-loader in `client/packages.json` from `"sass-loader": "^6.0.0"` to `"sass-loader": "^8.0.0"`
- add `bulma-extensions+2.2.2.patch` from the current repo to your `client/patches`
- update `client/vue.config.js` to compile the view locally instead of under the vendor folder
```
    filename: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
        ? '../resources/views/index.blade.php'
        : './index.html',
```
- update the default route in `routes/web.php` to
```
    Route::view('/{any}', 'index')->where('any', '.*');
```
- add in `.gitignore` the local view (`resources/views/index.blade.php`)
- since this version we went back on building the app for both legacy and modern browsers. To enable that you have to:
    - update the `babel.config.js` file to:
    ```
    module.exports = {
        presets: [
            '@vue/cli-plugin-babel/preset',
        ],
    };
    ```
    - add the `--modern` flag in `client/package.json` for the build script
    ```
    "build": "rm -rf ../public/{js,themes,themes-rtl,images} && vue-cli-service build --no-clean --modern",
    ```
- run `yarn upgrade && yarn` in `/client`
- run `composer update` in project root
- update the version to 3.8.1 in `config/enso/config.php`

### Note:
Besides what's mentioned above, you should go through these files in your project and align / adapt their content with the ones from the Enso repo:
- client/package.json
- client/vue.config.js
- client/babel.config.js
- .eslintrc.js and client/.eslintrc.js

## 3.8.0

**(optional)**

In order for the local project to be syntactically consistent with our ecosystem you should refactor as follows:
 * use typed properties where necessary
 * replace all `collect()` helpers with the `Collection()` facade
 * refactor closures to the new PHP7.4+ short closure syntax
 * split route files ( eg. https://github.com/laravel-enso/core/tree/master/src/routes )
 * if using `phpinsights`, don't forget to update the config file from `config/insights.php` ( https://github.com/laravel-enso/enso/blob/master/config/insights.php )
 * we have moved the local `User::class` from our Enso app under `App\Models` namespace. From now on, we have decided to keep the models in all of our projects under this namespace for better readability. If you wish to adopt this structure as well, don't forget to update your `config\auth.php` file.
```
'providers' => [
    'users' => [
        'driver' => 'eloquent',
        'model' => App\Models\User::class,
    ],
```
* the local factories and seeders have been updated to use short closures as well. if you wish, you can force publish the updated versions **(&nbsp;careful, this will overwrite your local customisations&nbsp;)** with:
    - `php artisan vendor:publish --force --tag=enso-factories`
    - `php artisan vendor:publish --force --tag=enso-seeders`

* if you wish to take advantage of the new tables feature which allows the use of custom cache keys for counts, your table builders must implement `CustomCountCacheKey()`.
* Regarding namespace was changed, you may need to migrate namespace in polymorphic relation in the database too.

## 3.7.4

This release improves the quality of the back-end code addressing issues revealed by [phpinsights](https://github.com/nunomaduro/) (more info in the back-end section) as well as the usual small updates and fixes.

### Upgrade steps

This is a non breaking upgrade:

* run `composer update`
* run `yarn upgrade && yarn` in `/client`
* update the version to 3.7.3 in `config/enso/config.php`

If you are not using the `products` package, there is nothing else for you to do.

Otherwise, you should run the products package's upgrade command, considering the following:
- the measurement units functionality was extracted to the `measurement-units` package and `products` now depends on it
- measurement units were stored in the products table's `measurement_units` column, and the values were taken from the `MeasurementUnits` enum
- that column is dropped and replaced with a `measurment_unit_id` column which points to the `measurement_units` table

If you did not customize the enum and were using the defaults, then you can simply run
`php artisan enso:products:upgrade` and the command will handle the necessary changes.

If you had customized/extended the enum, then you should provide the enum as a parameter to the upgrade command, in which case it will be used to seed the new measurment units:

`php artisan enso:products:upgrade --enum=App\\Enums\\MyEnum`

## 3.7.2

The main purpose of this release was to switch from using [tiptap](https://github.com/scrumpy/tiptap) to using [tinyMCE](https://www.tiny.cloud/) for our what-you-see-is-what-you-get editor VueJS component.

Through its dependency chain, after running `yarn upgrade` tiptap was breaking the build.

As a bonus, tinyMCE should be better supported and the VueJS wrapper components for it are slimmer and cleaner.

### front-end

#### wysiwyg
- drops tiptap in favour of tinyMCE (see more below)

#### forms
- updates the wyisiwyg field for the new tinyMCE powered wyisiwyg component

#### calendar
- reverts the resizing strategy

### back-end

#### companies
- within the static `owner` method the company model is resolved from the service container so that if you're extending & binding the package model to a local model, you will obtain the local instance

#### forms
- adds support for tinyMCE customization within the form configuration and the json templates
- fixes form params bug on create which caused the given parameter values to be ignored

#### localisation
- updated a couple of translation keys and values

### Upgrade steps

This is a non breaking upgrade:

* run `composer update`
* run `yarn upgrade && yarn` in `/client`
* update the version to 3.7.2 in `config/enso/config.php`
* update the `config/enso/forms.php` configuration file and add the new key:
```
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| TinyMCE Api Key
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| If you're using the wysiwyg field you need to get a free api key from
| https://www.tiny.cloud/get-tiny/ first.
|
*/

'tinyMCEApiKey' => env('TINY_MCE_API_KEY', null),
```

If you were not using the `wysiwyg` component, there is nothing else for you to do.

If you are using it, you will need to create an account on https://www.tiny.cloud/ ,
get an API key and add your application domains.

After obtaining your API key, add it to your `.env` file:
```
TINY_MCE_API_KEY=my-api-key
```

## 3.7.1

### front-end

#### calendar
- fixed request filter date format

#### filters
- fixes `fill` method for filter state
- limits width for picker inputs in date filter

#### tables
- improves global button actions handling

#### ui
- small changes to the AppUpdate messages; removed the version check when updating
- missing icon import fix

### back-end

#### companies
- added `Company::owner()` static helper method which returns the application owner company, based on the configured id (`config('enso.config.ownerCompanyId')` - more information below

#### core
- changed the AppUpdated notification tooltip message
- added `ownerCompanyId` key in `config.php`
- updated the `config.php` configuration, so that the values that make sense are read from the `.env` file if they provided
- cleanup of some deprecated image files

#### currencies
- fixes exchange fetcher service

#### forms
- fixed setting the route params for create
- added support for `pivotParams` & `customParams` meta properties for select

#### helpers

#### localisation
- updated/added a few translation keys and values

#### menus
- marked the computed icon not exportable in table thus fixing a table export issue

#### roles
- fixes role table to show users without default menu
- fixes config writer for users without role

### deprecated

#### examples
- the package is being deprecated and will no longer be maintained
- for new projects, the relevant functionality (sample data for the dashboard charts) has been moved locally within Enso
- for existing projects that may still use the package, they may continue using it

### Upgrade steps

This is a non breaking upgrade:
- run `composer update`
- run `yarn upgrade && yarn` in `/client`

### Company::owner()

The newly added method addresses the need to identify the Application's client or owner. Internally, we've handled this in various ways and, with this small update, we mean to provide an unified, consistent approach.

Since it makes sense that the Company model from the Companies package may be extended either in other packages or locally, the method's resulted class is resolved from the container.

Thus, if required, you can bind your desired/local implementation to the `LaravelEnso\Companies\app\Models\Company` class in the service provider.

You may set the application owner's company id within the main Enso configuration file (`enso.config.ownerCompanyId`).


## 3.7.0

The major purpose of this release is three fold:
* the switch to VueCli 4 which allows using the latest official VueJS tooling and should be more future-proof
* the date handling flow was simplified: we now expect that the front-end will send the date in the database's date format (usually `Y-m-d` or `Y-m-d H:i:s`) and on the back-end, all dates should be cast to Carbon\Carbon.
* the back-end packages were updated to require PHP 7.3+

future presets
- under the hood date format handling has been improved

#### forms

### Upgrade steps

Before getting into the actual upgrade steps, an overview of the changes is useful.

When switching from Laravel Mix to VueCli a few things happen:
- the front-end resources location will change from `resources/js` to `client/src/js`
- the front-end dependencies location will change from `node_modules` to `client/node_modules`
- the `package.json` configuration file location will change from project root to `client`
- the front-end patches location will change from `patches` to `client/patches`
- when installing dependencies using Yarn, building or serving the front-end, you will need to `cd` into the client folder first.
- instead of using Laravel Mix's `webpack.mix.js` file to configure the build, we will be using VueCli's `vue.config.js`
- we can still use Valet to serve the back-end but we must use `yarn serve` to serve the front-end for
hot module replacement

#### VueCli upgrade related steps
- copy the `client` folder from the Enso repo into your project root
- add any (package) aliases you had previously added to the `webpack.mix.js` file into:
    - the `settings.import-resolve.alias.map` section of the `client/.eslintrc.js` file
    - the `configureWebpack.resolve.alias` section of the `client/vue.config.js` file
- update/replace your project root `.eslintrc.js` with the contents from `client/.eslintrc.js` and correct the aliases paths
- if you had customized the `.babelrc` file, move those customizations to the `client/.babelrc` file, and remove the root file
- move your patches from `patches` to `client/patches`
- move any local dependencies you had added to the `package.json` to the `client/package.json` file
- move any additions from the `resources/js/app.js` file to the `client/src/js/app.js`
- move any additions from the `resources/js/localState.js ` file to the `client/src/js/localState.js `
- move any additions from the `resources/js/router.js ` file to the `client/src/js/router.js `
- move your local components, pages, routes & store from `resources/js` to `client/src/js`
- once you have moved your js files, you may delete the `resources/js` folder
- if you have any local image resources in `resources/images` you can create a `client/src/images` folder and move them there. Afterwards, you should add a configuration object to the CopyPlugin section from `vue.config.js` so that the images are copied on build.

    You may then delete the `resources/images` folder (the image files provided with Enso, such as the ones in the `emails` and `corners` have been extracted to their respective packages)
- move any additions from within the `resources/sass` files to the `client/src/sass` files
- once you've moved everything, the `resources` folder should look like on the Enso repo [here](https://github.com/laravel-enso/enso/tree/master/resources)

- remove the `webpack.mix.js` file
- update `.gitignore` using Enso's as example and double check `client/.gitignore`
- within `composer.json` update:
    - `laravel-enso/core` to `4.6.*`
    - `laravel-enso/calendar` to `1.4.*` (if using the calendar package)
- run `composer update` in the project root to update the back-end packages
- cd into the `client` folder and run `yarn` to install the front-end packages
- make a copy of the `client/.env.example` file, name it `.env`, then edit it an set the url you're currently using with Valet, for your project
- update the themes' configuration (`config/enso/themes`) to:
```php
return [
    'light' => 'light',
    'dark' => 'dark',
    'light-rtl' => 'light-rtl',
    'dark-rtl' => 'dark-rtl',
];
```

#### Enso upgrade related steps:
- search for any `DateAttributes` usages, remove the import and any date setters you might have added
- when refactoring date attributes, you may use this [commit](https://github.com/laravel-enso/people/commit/15ea16132957e3ce1bea9b1066fdb3e4f079e79e) as an example
- search and replace the `LaravelEnso\Addresses\app\Models\Country;` namespace with `LaravelEnso\Countries\app\Models\Country;`
- where using the `actions` slot within forms, replace the `actions` slot with `actions-left` and/or `actions-right` slots as required
- the local state implementation class should be bound in the service container to the `LaravelEnso\Core\app\Services\LocalState`
- publish the updated `AddressFactory.php`:
```
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=addresses-factory --force
```
- publish the updated `CountrySeeder.php`
```
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=countries-seeder --force
```
- if using the Calendar, also:
    - publish the calendar factories
    ```
    php artisan vendor:publish --tag=calendar-factories --force
    ```
    - add the calendar test suite to `phpunit.xml`:
    ```xml
        <testsuite name="calendar">
            <directory suffix="Test.php">./vendor/laravel-enso/calendar/tests</directory>
        </testsuite>
    ```
    - add the following namespace `"LaravelEnso\\Calendar\\tests\\features\\": "vendor/laravel-enso/calendar/tests/features/",` to `composer.json`'s `autoload-dev.psr-4`
- in `config/enso/config.php` increment the version to 3.7.0
- in `config/enso/forms.php` update the `dateFormat` key to `altDateFormat`
- cd into the `client` folder and serve the front-end with `yarn serve` or build it with `yarn build`
- (optional) a new feature allows you to notify your currently logged in users that a new application update/version was deployed.

    To use it, update your live deployment process and after the deploy is done, add a hook that calls `php artisan enso:announce-app-update`.
    The logged in users will get a toaster message as a well a pulsing notification control in the navbar, which, when clicked, will reload the page.

    Note that for the user to be notified, the current in-page version must be different from the released version, so don't forget to update the `enso.config.version` value.

    Reloading helps avoid js errors related to the lazy loading of the front-end assets as well as any mismatches between the stale front-end and the updated back-end API.

    The page reload is not done automatically for a better user experience as well as to give users the chance to save their work.

#### Serving the assets

Serving the assets has changed from running `yarn run hot` to cd-ing into the
`client` folder and running `yarn serve`.

No other steps are necessary if you are serving the back-end API as before, for example with Valet.

Alternatively, if you don't want to use Valet, you may run `php artisan serve` and then point to the back-end URL, within the `client/.env` config.

#### Building the assets

Building the assets has changed from running `yarn run prod` to cd-ing into the
`client` folder and running `yarn build`.

While the command is different, the resulted build is, for all practical purposes, identical to the one resulted when using Laravel Mix.

#### Deploying in production

To deploy the build you should follow the same flow as before.

IF within your workflow you are also building the front-end, you should update your scripts so as to take into the account the `client` folder (see above).

## 3.6.1

- adds a series of contracts besides `Table`:
    - `AuthenticatesOnExport` => should be used for tables where the logged user is needed for restricting visible rows or any other purpose. The exporter will make sure that the user who requested the export will be authenticated before any queries are performed
    - `CustomFilter` => should be used for tables when custom filter logic is needed via `params`. Will make sure that the correct count is displayed when custom filters are applied
    - `RawTotal` => should be used with tables where the total cannot be computed simply by adding up column values (e.g. `sum(price * quantity))
    - `Filter` => can be used to register local filters
    - `ComputesColumns` => can be used to register local computors
- improves exceptions
- adds template caching, configurable by global config or per table. Comes with a `php artisan enso:tables:clear` command that should be used on production when opting for cacheing templates

- determines the table's `name` property (if not provided in the template) by pluralising the `model` property (see above)
- the notification channels should be present in config `['mail', 'broadcast', 'database']
- all tests were refined

#### tutorials
- consolidates the two request validators for tutorial in one `ValidateTutorialRequest`
- upgrades the table for v3.0.0
- adds `TableCache` on the `Tutorial` model

### Upgrade Steps

- update `composer.json` dependencies to:
    - "laravel-enso/cli": "3.3.*"
    - "laravel-enso/core": "4.5.*"
    - "laravel-enso/pdf": "1.0.*"
    - "laravel-enso/excel": "1.0.*"
- add in `composer.json` => `autoload-dev.psr-4` section:
    - "LaravelEnso\\Cli\\tests\\": "vendor/laravel-enso/cli/tests/"
    - "LaravelEnso\\Tables\\Tests\\": "vendor/laravel-enso/tables/tests/"
- update `package.json` dependencies to:
    - "@enso-ui/accessories": "2.1.x"
    - "@enso-ui/bulma": "2.1.x"
    - "@enso-ui/directives": "1.0.x"
    - "@enso-ui/mixins": "1.0.x"
    - "@enso-ui/tables": "1.2.x"
    - "@enso-ui/themes": "1.0.x"
    - "@enso-ui/transitions": "1.0.x"
    - "@enso-ui/ui": "2.1.x"

- remove from `package.json`
    - "@enso-ui/filters": "^1.1.1"
    - "@enso-ui/forms": "~1.2.0"
    - "@enso-ui/select": "~1.1.1"

- run `composer update && yarn && yarn upgrade && yarn"
- run `php artisan enso:upgrade`

- add in phpunit.xml the test suite for activity-log
```xml
<testsuite name="activity-log">
    <directory suffix="Test.php">./vendor/laravel-enso/activity-log/tests/units</directory>
</testsuite>
```
- add in `config/enso/config.php` the `dateTimeFormat` key

#### activity-log
- truncate the `activity_logs` table. Or if required, you can manually migrate the old data to the new format
- publish the `LoggerServiceProvider` and configure it using the provider from this repo as an example: `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=activity-log-provider`
- update the UserSeeder ( if necessary ) so that it is compatible with the new `ActivityLog` structure

#### addresses
- add the to the addresses config file the `label` key

#### data-import
- add the new `Authenticates` contract to all imports that need the authenticated user

#### filters
- replace the `title` prop with `name` for all the usage instances of the following filters:
    - `BooleanFilter`,
    - `CoreSelectFilter`,
    - `EnsoFilter`,
    - `EnsoDateFilter`,
    - `DateFilter`,
    - `DateIntervalFilter`,
    - `EnsoSelectFilter`,
    - `IntervalFilter`,
    - `SelectFilter`
    - `VueFilter` .

    To do this you can search the whole resources folder for `title="`. Make sure you only replace the prop for filters and not other components
- make sure that the change in `date-filter` (described above at the front-end > filters section) does not impact your local use cases
- whenever using date-filters with tables, remove `dbDateFormat` and make sure `dateFormat` is present in the interval object, so the back-end knows it's a date interval. `dateFormat` should reflect the ui date format. If left null, the backend will consider `config('enso.config.dateFormat')`.

#### helpers
- make sure that you replace `isDisabled()` & `disable()` helpers usage with `isInactive()` & `deactivate()` and `disabled()` scope with `inactive()`

#### request validators
- most of the `ValidateModelStore` / `ValidateModelUpdate` request validators were consolidated into one `ValidateModelRequest` (see the changelog). Check all local classes that are extending Enso request validators and make sure they extend the right class.

#### tables
- remove the usage of the `Datatable` trait as it no longer exists. You may search for `use LaravelEnso\Tables\app\Traits\Datatable;` and remove any traces;
- refactor all the table builders to implement the new `Table` contract and expose the required `query()` and `templatePath()` methods. You can follow as example the refactor of the [permissions table](https://github.com/laravel-enso/permissions/commit/707255e3a95a6e8fd87b581db689dfb623449ed5#diff-04ef87d5f506cd5a1ed3d19c5fe0c96b)
- the `protected $templatePath` property has become `protected const TemplatePath`;
- if you have extended any of the core tables in your local project make sure to take into account the changes
- add in the tables.php config file the cache key and update (if required) the notifications value' => `['email', 'broadcast', 'database']`
- add in the tables.php config file under the export key => ``sheetLimit => 1000000``
- where used in templates, rename `count` with `countCache` or set it to `true` globally in the config
- where missing, add the `buttons` property in all templates  (empty array)
- see the above `filters` mentions regarding `dbDateFormat`
- add the `AuthenticatesOnExport` contract on tableBuilders that need the authenticated user on exports

- rename `structuremanager` test suite to `cli` in phpunit.xml
- remove from the local `User` model the `Addresses` & `Documents` traits
- update the `CompanyFactory` with the one from the github repo (of course, retain any local additions if necessary)
- update `enso/exports.php`, `enso/tables.php`, `laravolt/avatar.php` config files with the ones from the github repo
- delete the `enso/people.php` & `enso/companies.php` deprecated configs
- make sure to refactor any customisation to the people / companies forms or tables using dependency injection / binding in your `AppServiceProvider`. The old customization mechanisms which were using configs have been removed.
- search and replace `LaravelEnso\Helpers\app\Classes\Enum` => `LaravelEnso\Enums\app\Services\Enum`
- either refactor all table builders and remove the `dtRowId` alias for the id, or update your local table templates and add `"dtRowId": "dtRowId"`
- make sure you inject `route` in all the VueJS components where the helper is used. Search for "route()" in your resources folder and refactor
- refactor any customizations to documents, uploads, imports, exports to make use of the `AuthorizesFileAccess` contract
- update all importers and classes implementing the `BeforeHook`, `Importable` and `AfterHook` contracts, as the `before`, `run` and `after` method signatures have changed
and a and `$user` parameter was added
- add a `value` parameter to all `date-filters` or `enso-date-filters` component use
- if you are currently using the [Versioning](https://github.com/laravel-enso/versioning) package, manually add it as a dependency in your composer.json under `require`, as it was removed as a dependency from [Core](https://github.com/laravel-enso/core)
- run `php artisan enso:upgrade`
​
Optional:
- now you can register/add Enums directly from your packages, to the application state, by using an `EnumServiceProvider`.
Take a look at the `EnumServiceProvider` from the [People](https://github.com/laravel-enso/people) package as an example.
If using this method, you won't need to add them in the project's `LocalState`.#### Local project

## 3.3.0

# Purpose
- rename BE repos - when the organization was started we had not really followed
a consistent naming convention for the packages. But now we do :)
- use the same naming convention for migrations
- refactor controllers and request validators towards SRP,
with an invokable controller for each route endpoint
- switch to using dependency injection wherever possible in controllers,
to allow easier & cleaner customization of Models ($fillable, relations etc),
request validators, from builders, table builders, etc.
- replace the class registration part of the configs with service providers
- refactor `is_null($var)` usages to `$var === null`, following best practices
- remove `activity-log`'s default inclusion from all packages except from `teams`
- following several requests and real world requirements,
change the relationship between people and companies from `N - 1` to `N - N`

    - `UserGroup::Admin` constant has been removed and should be replaced with the `UserGroups::Admin` enum
    - `Role::AdminId` and `Role::SupervisorId` constants are no longer available and should be
        replaced with `Roles::Admin`, `Roles::Supervisor`; make sure to import the `LaravelEnso\Roles\app\Enums\Roles` enum
    - since the `Company` model's `scopeTenants` was renamed to `scopeTenant` search for its use and update as needed
    - `LaravelEnso\VueDatatable` with `LaravelEnso\Tables`
    - `LaravelEnso\Tables\app\Classes` with `LaravelEnso\Tables\app\Services`

- refactor local forms, if required:
    - local `person.json` template (`company_id` changed to company)
    - local `company.json` template (`mandatary_id` changed to mandatary)

- if using/customizing/extending addresses, people or companies (eventually any package):
    - you should switch to leveraging dependency injection and bind your local implementations to the package's models, validator classes
    - note that for both Person, Company and Address models the `$guarded` property was replaced with the explicit `$fillable`.
    - if extending any of these models, don't forget to overwrite the `$fillable` property
- if you're using/extending validators, controllers, models from the refactored packages, at minimum,
you will need to update your imports
- update `phpunit.xml` with the one from this repo
- make sure that in `webpack.mix.js` you don't have `sourceMaps()` for production
- don't forget to implement Searchable and Files for your required models. You can use `LaravelEnso\Companies\SearchServiceProvider` as example.

Enjoy!

## 3.0.0

## General

### Goals

We are always trying to move towards logic normalization (be it back end or front end), having the packages encapsulated, easy to work on, maintain, extend and customize.

Keeping the front-end assets together with the back-end code as well as having to publish everything on updates, managing what to overwrite or keep separate, was clearly not natural.

V3 is a big step in the right direction with the extraction of the front-end assets from the Composer packages and their move to individual NPM repositories.

### Rewrite

All the VueJS components have been rewritten (around 20k LOC have been updated/refactored), and now there is a more logical flow, components communicate better with each other, there's a greater degree of re-usability, removed duplicated logic, less lines of code (the old middleware is gone) and even a bit of extra functionality.

We went for "composition over inheritance" favoring slots over props.

Where it was feasible we created renderless components.

We made use of dependency injection to replace global mixins or to share the state in specific components / libs.

After the refactor most of the middlewares were removed.

We tried to remove all the `scoped` scss styling from the vue components, opening them up for local customization

We added friendly aliases for imports.

### NPM packages

We strived to create packages for every piece of functionality. This is still an ongoing process.

All the new packages can be found under the @enso-ui organisation on both github and npmjs.

For the active components we went for encapsulating the front end behavior in renderless components, and creating template wrappers.

### Theming and styling

As before, Enso ships with two themes, one dark and one light.
The themes and the overall styling have been organized better, offer the possibility of easier customization and can be found in the @enso-ui/themes package.

It's easier to style specific components on both themes by creating a single scss file that uses variables, and place this file under the `/components` folder

### Development & Customization

If previously, the best/only way to customize some of the pages was to create your own local copies and then making sure you overwrite the default Enso pages with your own versions, now you can customize the assets much easier. You can do this by either rewriting core-routes in your local project and point to local pages, or you can use (patch-package)[https://www.npmjs.com/package/patch-package] and customize anything in a package without having to manually maintain the differences.

You can easily write your own version for any asset while taking advantage of the existing behaviour contained in the renderless components. This even makes switching Enso from Bulma to the CSS framework of your choice much easier.

Therefore, for most packages, you have the possibility to:
- customize the components within the packages and then use patch-package, or
- locally create your own version of the component  and change the imports to use your local component

For the theme customization you can:
- customize the styles within the theme package and then use patch-package, or
- create your own theme, locally, and change the theme import in webpack.mix.js

You can develop your own components and pages by importing just the bits and pieces you need.

Remember, should you need a custom behavior for a component, or your own version of a component with different styling you can build it your own way as most complex components have the core logic encapsulated in renderless components.

If making package fixes we kindly ask you to also open a github issue and a pull request, since this helps the whole community.

### Enso vs Standalone

In the past, even if we're done our best to make some of the components work outside of the Enso ecosystem, there hasn't been a clear distinction between the integrated and the standalone components.

With the rewrite, all the packages were designed to be also Enso independent, and may be used in any vue project.

If you are developing your project within the Enso ecosystem, the Enso versions of the components offer a tighter integration into the framework,
automatically determining and using:
- the user's locale
- dynamically determined routes
- the internationalization helper
- the app's error handling
- the user's date format

### Bug Fixes & Improvements
- page transitions are in better sync
- the theme changing system was refactored and it's more efficient
- the bookmarks bar is sticky
- the document title is properly handled / translated
- totals & numbers alignment in vue table
- several levels of span removed in vue table
- several edge cases fixed in vue-select

- if necessary, update `App\Exceptions\Handler` to include the new sentry reporting syntax

- update the sentry config and remove the `user_context` option which is now deprecated

- `yarn install && yarn upgrade`

- `canAccess` must be injected where it is used

- if you have customized Enso, use `patch-package` to reapply those customizations for each individual package. Note that when using yarn, the [postinstall-postinstall](https://github.com/ds300/patch-package#why-use-postinstall-postinstall-with-yarn) package is also needed.

- build

- replace all relative RouterView imports such as `const RouterView = () => import('../../../core/Router.vue');` with the package import `const RouterView = () => import('@core-pages/Router.vue');`

- replace relative routeImporer imports such as: `import routeImporter from '../modules/importers/routeImporter;` with the package import : `import routeImporter from '@core-modules/importers/routeImporter';`

- comment out the import of the `tiptap-extensions` from `/resources/js/components/enso/vueforms/Wysiwyg.vue`

- in `resources/images` ensure you have `earthlink.svg` & `enso-favicon.png`

- when adding your own local routes that overwrite or reuse part or the core routes, ensure that
within the route file you expose only the `path` and the `children` properties. If you also set the `meta` property, that would result in having the core routes overwritten by your local routes vs having the local routes merged into the core routes.

- move the icon imports from `resources/js/core/structure/menu/icons/app.js` to `resources/js/app.js`

- Migrate all pages/components by looking at the [New Packages section](#new-packages).

- inject `i18n` and `errorHandler` everywhere they're used

## 2.14.0

### Changes
This is one of the biggest releases until now, with changes such as the complete rewrite of the Data Import package, the rewrite and improvement of the DataTable Export functionality, enhancements and new functionality for the VueForm and much more.
The improvements brought to the DataTable Export and the DataImport now allow the export of practically unlimited records from a datatable, as well as the import of xlsx files limited only by your ability to create them and the limitations of the file format.
That's not all though, as the new mechanisms also become much much more efficient due to the parallelization of the operations. This is made possible by leveraging Laravel's queueing facilities and impressive load balancing.
Together with the refreshed web socketed operations' progress reporting we now have hugely powerful, high throughput solutions for I/O operations.
This is yet another step towards our vision for Enso and rest assured, there is more to come.

#### Core
- adds IO structure for monitoring background export/import operations progress in real-time (needs websockets). It will soon be refactored and extracted to its own separate package
- fixes the global search on medium screen sized devices
- refactors the request management helpers
- adds params support for translations, thanks to @jlsjonas
- fixes translation for the `auth` layout
- adds a `shortNumber` filter ( `{{ 1000 | shortNumber }} // 1k`)
- globally adds the `font-awesome-layers` component under the name of `fal`
- both the `dataimport` and `companies` packages are now required by `core` and are no longer optional

#### DataExport
- adds `type`, `entries`, `status` and `created_by` columns to the table
- uses the `CreatedBy` trait
- integrates with the new background operations management system (IO) for real time progress in the FE

#### DataImport
- completely redesigned the package and import philosophy. Adds support for a virtually infinite number of rows that can imported in the same import with very low memory consumption, by splitting the import file in chunks and processing them in queued jobs
- adds queue management
- generates a downloadable xlsx rejected rows summary if there are import validation errors. The summary has the same structure as the import file with an extra column (on each sheet) that will describe all the validation errors for each row. This will streamline the import operations when dealing with large files
- improves local (dev's) import and validation classes
- adds `before` and `after` hooks which are available in the importing process
- integrates with the new background operations management system (IO) for real time progress in the FE
- comes with a new `import-uploader` component that can be placed anywhere in the applications for local imports

#### Helpers
- enhances the `Obj` class. Now it can receive any object or associative array, including Laravel collections, and even Models with loaded relations.
- changed the `Obj@get($key)` method to return `null` for an unset `$key`, instead of throwing an exception
- enhances the Enum by reordering the data source priority. Take a look at `LaravelEnso\Examples\app\Enums\SeniorityEnum` for an example

#### FormBuilder
- adds the `tabs` property to the form template root. If provided, it will require a `tab` property for each section, which will represent the tab's label. The sections will be grouped in tabs using their given labels
- the delete modal has the commit button focused by default
- exposes a series of getters/helpers from `vue-from` and `enso-form` that can be accessed via `$refs`:
    - computed:
        - `data` - represents the whole object
        - `customFields` - represents  custom fields array
        - `errors` - represents the errors object
    - methods
        - `formData()` - returns the params that are sent to the server on POST / PATCH
        - `field(field)` - returns the field object for a given label
        - `param(param)` - returns the specified param from the optional `params` object
        - `routeParam(param)` - returns the route param from the `routeParams` object
        - `fetch()` - form's fetch method for getting the template

#### VueComponents
- removes the deprecated `MorpableContainer`
- adds a new `enso-tabs` component. The old `tabs` component is visually limited to the Bulma available options. `enso-tabs` has less props and displays the custom tabs used in the Files menu, the `accesories` component and in `vue-form` (new!)
- adds compact mode to `accesories`

#### VueDatatable
- adds practically unlimited excel export functionality by greatly improving the table fetcher. The whole process is done in the background and uses a small amount of memory. You should consider using appropriate values for the configuration options `enso.datatable.exports.timeout` and for the `queues.connections.yourConnection.retry_after`
- improves the builder logic and reusability
- optimizes the Builder for date / enum / translatable computing
- renamed the `translation` template param to `translatable`
- the (delete) modal accepts `shift-enter` as a keyboard shortcut for the commit action
- changes the way actions are processed. Now, in the `CustomAction@process` class / method only one `$row` at a time will be available
- adds options for customizing the export & notification queues
- integrates with the new background operations management system (IO) for real time progress in the FE

### Upgrade instructions - estimated time per project ~ 10-15min
- update in `composer.json`: "laravel-enso/core": "3.4.*"
- from `composer.json`, remove the packages:
    * "laravel-enso/companies"
    * "laravel-enso/dataimport"
- run `composer update`
- run `php artisan migrate`
- run `yarn upgrade`
- run `yarn run dev`
- run `php artisan enso:upgrade`
- add the new route in your `routes/channels.php` file
    ```php
    Broadcast::channel('operations.{userId}', function ($user, $operationId) {
        return (int) $user->id === (int) $operationId;
    });
    ```
- in your `config/queue.php` file make sure that you set `retry_after` to a higher value for the imports / exports connection (we are using 1800)
- update the configuration files with the newly introduced options:
    * `config/enso/imports.php` with `vendor/laravel-enso/dataimport/src/config/imports.php`
    * `config/enso/datatable.php` with `vendor/laravel-enso/vuedatatable/src/config/datatable.php`
- configure your `config/horizon.php` to make sure that you have the appropriate queues for both local and production envs. You can use the config from this repo as an example.
- refactor your import classes and validators to match the new structure
- if necessary, in your table templates, rename the attribute `translation` to `translatable`
- sync `phpunit.xml` with the one from the main repo

## 2.13.17

- fixes small bugs
- upgrades date-fns to the latest alpha

To upgrade existing projects:

- run `composer update`
- update in your package.json `"date-fns": "^2.0.0-alpha.7"`
- run `yarn install`
- update in `config/enso/config.php` `jsDateFormat => 'dd-MM-yyyy'`
- read [this](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/master/docs/unicodeTokens.md)
- update in your code the date format [accordingly](https://date-fns.org/v2.0.0-alpha.26/docs/format)

## 2.13.16

### Changes and upgrade instructions:

#### General

#### FormBuilder
- adds template fetching logic VueForm similar to VueTable
- adds EnsoForm for using VueForm in the Enso environment. VueFormSS is be deprecated and must be replaced with EnsoForm. For existing projects you can safely search & replace all instances of `vue-form-ss` with `enso-form` and `VueFormSS` with `EnsoForm`
- adds & refactors field helpers in VueForm / EnsoForm:
    - `field(value)`
    - `param(param)`
    - `routeParam(param)`
    - `customFields` - computed property

To upgrade besides the above notes you must manually bump the core version in your composer.json:
    - "laravel-enso/core": "3.3.*"

Run `composer update`, `yarn upgrade`, compile and enjoy

- fixes the default spa redirect to allow Laravel routes caching see [#169](https://github.com/laravel-enso/Enso/issues/169)

Upgrade steps:

- update `telescope.php` with the one provided in the project
- in `web.php` file change the SPA redirect from

```php
Route::get('/{any}', function () {
    return view('laravel-enso/core::index');
})->where('any', '.*');
```

to

```php
Route::view('/{any}', 'laravel-enso/core::index')

## 2.13.0

### General
This version greatly improves the permission management system by simplifiyng parts of the core structure and generally allowing for more flexibility.

It also adds a set of changes that widen convention based matchings (for routes, parameters, models, etc.) while reducing a significant amount of lines of code and improving readability.

The permissions table provides all the needed information when checking user access for both routes and menus. That said, the `menu_role` pivot table was dropped as it's no longer needed. The menus section from the role configurator was also dropped and the UI streamlined.

The menu table was improved by replacing the `link` column, that was previously string and stored the permission name, with `permission_id` (nullable for parent menus).

The `Permission Groups` were also dropped (menu, table, relation to permissions). The grouping for permission is determined dynamically based on the route name prefixes. This permits  any type of nested routes structure and removes the previous restriction of having to provide the same number of depth levels for all the route subgroups. Now we can have `administration.companies.routeNames` and also `administration.companies.contacts.routeName` and the improved interface will handle this structure.

The frontend routing was adjusted slightly to better match the backend routing, in the sense that all the route parameters are now named after the model instead of the generic `id`  (for instance, `adminisration/users/:id/edit` became `administration/users/:user/edit`) similar to Laravel conventions.

Read all the notes below before jumping to the `Upgrade steps`.

### Upgrading existing projects

#### Important Notes
- make sure you read all of the above.
- the upgrade steps presented below will work only for Enso **v2.12.8**. If you are not already at this version, make sure that you upgrade to v2.12.8 before jumping to v2.13.x

#### Upgrade steps
- update in your `composer.json`: "laravel-enso/core": "3.2.*",
- run `composer update`
- run `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=menus-factory --force
- run `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=roles-seeder --force
- run `php artisan enso:upgrade`

**search & replace**

- search the whole project for `protected $permissionGroup` and remove the property from all structure migrations (optional)
- search for `getTableData` and replace it with `tableData` in all the route files and structure migrations
- search for `readSuffix` in your table templates and remove it if you want to use the global `dataRouteSuffix` from the config or replace it with `dataRouteSuffix` if you need a custom one
- add the `'dataRouteSuffix' => 'tableData',` line in your `config/enso/datatable.php` config file
- search for `'link' => '` and replace it with `'route' => '` in all your structure migrations
- search for `'id' => $` in all your crud controllers (store() methods) and update the returned array from
`'id' => $model->id,` to `'param' => ['model' => $model->id],` where `model` will correspond to the according path segment (model name)
- search for `:id` in all your frontend routes and replace `id` with `model` where model is the actual camelCase model, matched with the one from the backend route.
- search for `:route-params="[$route.name, null, false]"` in your 'Create' pages and remove it. Now the vue-form-ss defaults to this. (optional)

## 2.12.0

Facing our latest challenges we decided to change the way users are handled in Enso by introducing a new structure of *people*. This was the main objective of this upgrade.

Some of the people will be users (all users are people), some can be contacts (soon), some can be clients or employees, and some can be of all types at once. This structure will handle all the personal information for persons that are relevant to the app.

The second objective was cleaning up and improving the code, trying to make everything simpler and more consistent. We tried to rename what was was confusing, to move logic to where it belongs and so on.

The majority of tests were also improved.

### Upgrade steps
For existing projects we created an upgrade command that will take care of most of the changes, like migrating the current user table into two tables, users & people, and so on.

Make sure you have a backup of your database before starting. If you find any problems use the issue tracker to let us know.

- update `composer.json` dependencies:
    - "laravel-enso/addressesmanager": "2.4.*",
    - "laravel-enso/commentsmanager": "2.4.*",
    - "laravel-enso/companies": "1.0.*",
    - "laravel-enso/contacts": "2.3.*",
    - "laravel-enso/dataimport": "2.5.*",
    - "laravel-enso/discussions": "1.1.*",
    - "laravel-enso/documentsmanager": "2.4.*",
    - "laravel-enso/how-to": "2.2.*",
    - "laravel-enso/teams": "1.0.*",
- run `composer update`
- run `php artisan enso:upgrade`
- run `php artisan migrate`
- run `php artisan enso:upgrade` (again, don't ask :) )
- run `php artisan enso:update-global-preferences`
- run `php artisan enso:track-who:update`
- read the individual package changes below, and where you find upgrade instructions follow those steps.
- run `yarn dev` / `npm run dev`

Note: The upgrade command will do the following:
- rename migrations to match the new names (for example the owner related migrations)
- rename the `owners` & `owner_role` tables and relevant relation columns
- prepares the `users` table to work with `people`
- splits users data into `users` and `people`
- removes all the deprecated permissions and renames one that were changed (`selectOptions` => `options` and so on)
- updates the menus to reflect the new structures;

### ActionLogger
#### Changes
- renamed the `HasActionLogs` trait to `ActionLogs`
- improved test

#### Upgrade
This change should not affect existing projects.

### ActivityLog
#### Changes
- renamed the `LogActivity` trait to `LogsActivity`
- the logger will not attempt to persist data when there is no authenticated user - this was causing problems when using seeder / playing in tinker etc

#### Upgrade
Search in the whole project for `LogActivity` and replace it with `LogsActivity`.

### AddressesManager
#### Changes
- **changed how the morphable relation is handled** <a id="morphable"></a>
- the front-end component works now takes the destination model's *classname* instead of an alias
-  the `addressable_type` and `addressable_id` are dynamically assigned in the form object inside the `AddressForm` component
- the index request is now validated and helps the dev properly configure the front-end component
- as a result of these changes:
    - the back-end logic is more natural without having to create a custom store method
    - there is no need for the `addressable` key from the `addresses.php` config, it can now be removed
    - the `ConfigMapper` was deprecated and removed

- an observer was added that will automatically set the first added address as the default
- the `countriesSelectOptions` route/permission was renamed to `countryOptions`

#### Upgrade
To upgrade, manually replace the provided `type` property where the front-end component is used, replacing the old alias with the mapped class from the `addresses.php` config. Afterwards, remove the `addressable` key from the config. (see [this change](https://github.com/laravel-enso/Enso/commit/be5743c80bf028468ae5dbf30956b5c87d30c634#diff-c55ea2ae73bcf4f5d68ad75da15d5546) for an example)

## 2.12.0-beta

You definately shouldn't update to this version. In the next days we will refine the upgrade process and commit a new version with the full changelog. Stay tuned...

## 2.11.13
Improves history tabs. When updating existing apps use the delete button to clear previous tabs from the local storage to fully make use of the new behavior.

## 2.11.12

After a thorough analysis we decided to slighly change the behaviour of `TrackWho`. In all the traits `auth()->user()->id` was changed to `optional(auth()->user())->id`. This way we allow easier tests, seeders, tinker playing etc., on models that use one ore more of the three traits. In conjunction with this move, all the tables that have `created_by` should update the column to be `nullable()`. For Enso's tables we added a command for this `enso:track-who:update`
- removes unnecessary logic from `UserSeeder` and `OwnerSeeder`
- fixes tabs/custom tabs css

Upgrade steps:
- run `composer update`
- run `php artisan enso:track-who:update`
- update user and owner seeders with the ones from `laravel-enso/core` if they are not customized already (optional)

## 2.11.11

This version is a step forward in the direction of abstracting Enso from a clean Laravel project.

Changes and upgrade instructions:

- update in your `composer.json` the `core` requirement to `"laravel-enso/core": "3.1.*",`
- the examples were moved in a dedicated `examples` package. To upgrade, remove everyting related to examples:
    - remove the files (copy everything below in one take and paste it into the terminal)
        ```
        rm app/Example.php
        rm -R app/Http/Controllers/Examples
        rm database/factories/ExampleFactory.php
        rm database/migrations/2018_01_29_204255_create_examples_table.php
        rm -R resources/views/examples
        rm -R resources/assets/js/tableExample.js
        rm -R resources/assets/js/selectExample.js
        ```
    - remove the routes under the `Examples` namespace from the `routes/web.php` file:
        ```php
        Route::namespace('Examples')
            ->prefix('examples')->as('examples.')
            ->group(function () {
                Route::view('table', 'examples.table.index')->name('table');

                Route::prefix('table')->as('table.')
                    ->group(function () {
                        Route::get('init', 'TableController@init')->name('init');
                        Route::get('data', 'TableController@data')->name('data');
                        Route::get('exportExcel', 'TableController@exportExcel')->name('exportExcel');
                    });

                Route::view('select', 'examples.select.index')->name('select');

                Route::prefix('select')->as('select.')
                    ->group(function () {
                        Route::get('employee', 'EmployeeSelectController@options')->name('employee');
                    });
            });
        ```
    - remove from webpack the following lines:
        ```js
        .js('resources/js/tableExample.js', 'public/js')
        .js('resources/js/selectExample.js', 'public/js')
        ```
    - NOTE: if you still need examples in your project (the dashboard for instance) run `composer require laravel-enso/examples`, put back in `webpack.js` the two lines from the previous step and run `php artisan vendor:publish --force --tag="examples-assets"
- the `Owner` & `User` models were moved to `core`. To upgrade
    - remove `app/Owner.php`. If in the future you will need customization over this model you can create it locally but be sure to extend the one from core.
    - update `app/User.php` content to:
        ```php
        <?php

            namespace App;

            use LaravelEnso\Core\app\Models\User as EnsoUser;

            class User extends EnsoUser
            {
                //
            }
        ```
        If you have customizations, add them as well
- the form and tables (buiders, template, controllers) and the corresponding routes were moved to the `core` package. To upgrade, remove the following files/routes (if you customized some of the files then skip those and the corresponding routes if appliable):
    - `app/Forms/Builders/UserForm.php`

                            ->prefix('users')->as('users.')
                            ->group(function () {
                                Route::get('initTable', 'UserTableController@init')
                                    ->name('initTable');

## 2.10.1

Laravel 5.7 upgrade

We decided to cleanup the project's root and to try to make Enso installable on any existing or new Laravel application. This is a direction / objective that we'll follow in the near future.

### Changes

- Laravel 5.7 upgrade :)
- improved Enso's `Toastr`, now allowing 6 positions (desktop corners)
- new preferences setting that for customizing the toastr position
- bulma dropdown now hides after a selection is made by default. Has a new `hides-manually` prop
- updated the vuedatatable style selector and columns visibility dropdowns
- updated the dropdowns from setttings (right aside bar)
- moves the auth controllers to the core package, leaving the ones from the base project back to Laravel's original.
- removed the deprecated `Nprogress.vue` component from `vue-components` repo
- replaces `nprogress` dependency with an in house progress bar implementation that is integrated in the core. Now the animation is indeed controlled and the effect more natural
- adds a `requests` array to the app's state that tracks all the pending requests. From now on the application won't allow a second requests to the same endpoint / method before receiving the response for the initial one. Le me know your thoughs on this...
- adds the missing `StructureManager` tests to `phpunit.xml`
- adds desktop notifications - ref laravel-enso/enso#136

### Upgrading an existing project

- first be sure that you follow [L5.7 upgrade guide](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/upgrade)
- update in your `composer.json`: `"laravel/framework": "5.7.*",`
- update in your `composer.json`: `"sentry/sentry-laravel": "dev-laravel-57@dev",`
- unless you already customized the auth routes already remove from your `api.php` routes file the whole route group under the `Auth` namespace. - now they are loaded from the core package
- replace the four auth controllers with the ones from this repo (`app/Http/Controllers/Auth/*`)
- add to your `phpunit.xml` the test suite for `StructureManager`
- run `php artisan enso:clear-preferences`
- run `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=enso-preferences --force`
- remove `nprogress` from your `package.json` and run `yarn upgrade`

## 2.10.0

This is a mostly a back end refactor.

Among the goals:
- dropping all the accessors (appends) that were using relationships in favor of getters
- adding query scopes where they were missing
- implementing resources ... something that we wanted for months
- making all FormBuilders DRY
- cleaning up and aligning all the service providers
- refined tests
- improving the form request validators
- getting the project mature...

### Additions & Changes

#### Activity Log
- refactored main query into scopes

#### AddressesManager
- adds `Address` resource
- adds `buildingTypes` and resource attributes to the config

#### AvatarMangager
- drops the `getAvatarIdAttribute`.
- adds an `created` event listener on the `User` model which automagically generates a new avatar for every created user
- adds the `generateAvatar()` method that can be called on any User. Note, in order to use this method you will have to be authenticated because the avatar relies on the `File` model that uses the `CreatedBy` trait.
- adds `php artisan enso:avatars:generate` - command that generates all the missing avatars

#### CommentsManager
- adds `Comment` resource. Major backend refactor

#### Core
- `Resource::withoutWrapping()` was added in the `AppServiceProvider`. Let's hope that this is a good decision :)
- `avatarId` was removed from the user's model `protected $fillable` array. Don't forget to do the same in your existing project(s). Read **Upgrade Instructions** for more details
- adds a `Team` resource
- adds the `Update` command

#### DocumentsManager:
- added document request validation
- added a new `ordered()` scope (most recent first)
- added the `Document` resource

### HowToVideo
- clean up, added resources

#### TrackWho
- we have now a `TrackWho` resource and a `trackWho` config (publishable). You can customize the attributes in the `TrackWho` resource from the config.

#### FileManager
- added the `File` resource.

#### FormBuilder
- fixed a validation for multiple selects with mutated value.

### RolesManager
- turned the `getRoleListAttribute` accessor into a getter - `rolesList()` in `HasRoles` trait. Updated the formbuilders for the models that were using this trait to use the getter instead of the accessor

### Upgrade Instructions *~ 3-5 mins*
- update in composer.json: "laravel-enso/core": "2.14.*"
- run `composer update`
- run `php artisan enso:update` - this command will align some inconsistent column types and clear unused columns
- remove the `avatarId` field from the `protected $fillable` array in your `App\User` model
- update the avatar column definition in your `app/Forms/Templates/users.json` table template to
```json
{
    "label": "",
    "name": "avatarId",
    "data": "avatars.avatarId",
    "meta": ["slot"],
    "class": "is-paddingless"
},
```
- remove from the same template (`users.json`) the deprecated `avatarId` from the appends array. The result should be `"appends": ["fullName"],`
- update in `app/Tables/Builders/UserTable.php` the query method to:
```php
public function query()
{
    return User::selectRaw(
            'users.id, users.id as "dtRowId", avatars.id as avatarId, owners.name as owner,
            users.first_name, users.last_name, users.phone, users.email, roles.name as role,
            users.is_active'
        )->join('owners', 'users.owner_id', '=', 'owners.id')
        ->join('roles', 'users.role_id', '=', 'roles.id')
        ->leftJoin('avatars', 'users.id', '=', 'avatars.user_id');
}
```
- replace both `app/Forms/Builders/OwnerForm.php` & `app/Forms/Builders/UserForm.php` with the ones from the repo (this is not mandatory, and must be done with care if you have already customized your local builders)
```
- sync the `config/enso/config.php` keys with the keys from `vendor/laravel-enso/core/src/config/config.php`
- replace `tests/Feature/OwnerTest.php` &&  `tests/Feature/UserTest.php` with the one from the repo - or manually update if you have local changes
- modify the slot rendering in `resources/assets/js/pages/administration/users/Index.vue` to
```vue
<img class="is-rounded"
    :src="avatarLink(row.avatarId)"
    v-if="row.avatarId">
```
- add in 'database/seeds/UserSeeder.php` after the actual seed the following line`\Artisan::call('enso:avatars:generate');`

## 2.9.0

This version is a major backend refactor. It has breaking changes so read carefully the needed steps for upgrading existing projects. We created an artisan command that does all the hard work during the upgrade, so don't worry.

### Changes

#### File System
- the file system has been rewritten around a single `FileManager` class that makes full use of Laravel's `UploadedFile` class
- there is a `files` table now that keeps track of all the files in the application. The `File` model has a polymorphic 'attachable` relationship to any needed model.
- to develop new packages that work with file uploads all you need is the new `HasFile` trait and implementing the `Attachable` contract.
The trait creates a `file` `morphOne` relationship to the base model and makes available all the needed methods: `inline()`, `download()`, `upload(UploadedFile $file)`. There are also helpers (check the contract / trait) and protected properties that can be used for configuring the specific of the model related to files, like:
    - `folder`: string the storage folder for the model's files
    - `mimeTypes`: array
    - `extensions`: array
    - `resizeImages`: array(width, height)
    - `optimizeImages`: boolean
- the trait adds a `deleting` event on the base model that makes sure the to associated files are delelted on `$model->delete()`
- when the env is testing `FileManager` uses a `testing` folder
- upgraded packages: AvatarManager, DataImport, DocumentsManager, FileManager, HowToVideos

#### Seeders
- until now the app was using migrations instead of seeders for inserting the default roles, owner and user. This version adds seeders for roles, default user, default owners, and countries (for the addresses package)
- the seeders can be published with `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=enso-seeders`. Use the `--force` flag if needed.

### Roles
- we have now a `php artisan enso:roles:sync` command that will help keeping the all the environments up to date.

### Upgrade steps for existing projects

- update in composer.json the following:
    - "laravel-enso/core": "2.13.*",
    - "laravel-enso/dataimport": "2.3.*",
    - "laravel-enso/documentsmanager": "2.3.*",
    - "laravel-enso/how-to": "2.1.*",
- run `composer update`
- run `php artisan migrate`
- run `php artisan enso:filemanager:upgrade`. This command will translate all the tables from the old format to the new one. It's recommended to make a backup of the database before the update, just to be sure that nothing goes wrong.
- run `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=enso-seeders --force` to update the seeders (Database, Role, Owner & User) if you didn't make any customizations to the existing ones.

#### Files & Folders to delete
- remove the `insert_default_owner` & `insert_default_user` migrations
- remove the `app/storage/temp` folder, it's no longer needed

#### Files that need to be replaced & edited according to the repo
- sync the `config/enso/config.php` keys with the keys from `vendor/laravel-enso/core/src/config/config.php`
- replace `tests/Feature/OwnerTest.php` with the one from the repo.
- replace `tests/Feature/UserTest.php` with the one from the repo.
- replace `resources/assets/js/pages/administration/users/Index.vue` with the one from the repo.
- edit `storage/app/.gitignore` file and replace `temp` with `testing`
- add in `app/User.php` the `avatarId` attribute to fillable
- add in `app/Tables/Builders/UserTable.php` `users.id` to the table select (`users.id, users.id as "dtRowId"`). We need this for showing the avatar in the users index table
- replace `app/Tables/Templates/users.json` with the one from the repo.

### Notes
- this is a pretty heavy upgrade, if you find any problems open issues in github, issues for this upgrade will be prioritized

Now you can audit your user's activity within the application from the new menu.

To upgrade an existing project update in your `composer.json`: "laravel-enso/core": "2.12.*" and after the update run the migrations. If you want smarter logging for contacts, addresses, comments & documents update their configs matching the ones from a blank project.

The documentation will be updated soon.

Meanwhile, take a look at the new `LogsActivity` trait. For examples peek at the `User` model from a blank project and for polymorphic relations at the `Comment` model from the `CommentsManager` packages.

## 2.8.18

- adds custom totals in VueTable.

## 2.8.17

- upgrades Laravel to 5.6.31

- flows optimisation

Changes overview:
- separated site layouts: `Auth`, `Home`, `Default`
- better management of transitions between different UI stages, such as authentication to main
- optimizations to the app routing
- middleware is now used for the router; The users access will be filtered in the front-end too, based on their permissions; This means that all the FE permissions must be present in the `permissions` table and attached to the according roles. In the near future you'll be able to also add your own middleware too

- resolved visual issues during theme loading
- improved the 'Page not found' page; added the 'Unauthorized' page
- improved title management for pages with a dedicated middleware, fixed issue where the title was missing in some scenarios and also translation issues
- addressed a role configurator bug when having more than one menu with the same name
- moved the logic for handling missing translation keys to the store `localisation` module
- many other front-end cleanup & optimizations
- tree permission builder refactor for the back-end role configurator
- added logic to handle front-end only permissions, with no corresponding back-end routes

For an existing project the upgrade estimated time is ~ 5min. **TESTED**

To upgrade a project do the following:
* update `composer.json` for the new core version to `2.10.*` (please double check all the enso requirements against a composer.json from a fresh project)
* run `composer update`
* run `php artisan enso:add-missing-permissions`
* make sure to manually add to the permissions table all the FE-only permissions and attach them to the according roles
* following is the reorganized structure (read with care!!!) of the core application layout files:
    - `js/core`
        - `structure`: the structural sub-components of the app
            - `navbar` (top)
            - `sidebar` (left) -> bring your own `/icons/app.js` file under this folder
            - `settings` (right sidebar)
            - `AppFooter.vue`: -> use your own file
            - `Breadcrumbs.vue`
            - `PageHeader.vue`
            - `VueAside.vue`
        - `App.vue`
        - `NotFound.vue`
        - `Router.vue` -> Update the path to this file in all the routes / pages that use the Router
        - `Unauthorized.vue`

* remove the old `js/pages/layout` with all its content

* nprogress usage
    - if using the nprogess events, replace old logic as these events have been removed:
        - `nprogress-add-request`
        - `nprogress-add-response`
        - `nprogress-done`
    - the nprogress instance is now directly available in the Vue root instance with `this.$router.app.$nprogress` with `incRequests()` / `incResponses()` methods

* middleware
    - the referenced files are:
        - `js/middleware/before/allow.js` -> used for restricting access on forbidden routes
        - `js/middleware/before/auth.js`
        - `js/middleware/before/nprogress.js`
        - `js/middleware/before/guest.js`
        - `js/middleware/after/nprogress.js`
        - `js/middleware/after/documentTitle.js`

* authentication pages/components, will be published automatically on update
    - the referenced files are:
        - `js/pages/auth/AuthForm.vue`
        - `js/pages/auth/Login.vue`
        - `js/pages/auth/password/Email.vue`
        - `js/pages/auth/password/Reset.vue`

* dashboard
    - the referenced file is:
        - `js/pages/dashboard/Index.vue` -> it needs to be copied from the Enso repository, overwriting the existing file

* administration routes
    - the referenced files are:
        - `js/routes/administration.js`
        - `js/routes/administration/owners.js`
        - `js/routes/administration/users.js`
    - the above files have been updated and need to be copied from the Enso repository,  overwriting the existing files

* run `npm run dev`
* sync the routes in `routes/api.php` with the ones from a fresh project

## 2.7.12
- fixes the publishing path for `HowToVideo.vue`
- fixes keys in `Documents.vue`
- refactors CommentsManager with a breaking change.
To update an existing project first change the composer requirement to : "laravel-enso/commentsmanager": "2.3.*", and after the update run `php artisan enso:comments:update-table`

## 2.7.11
General BE refactor.

Steps for upgrade:
- update in your composer.json file the requirement for core: `"laravel-enso/core": "2.9.*"`
- `php artisan enso:update-action-logs-table`
- `composer update`
- `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=charts-config --force` for an updated color list.
- optionally list of files with small refactors which can be manually replaced from a fresh project: 'UserController.php', 'UserSelectController.php', 'ValidateOwnerRequest.php', 'ValidateUserRequest.php', 'User.php'

## 2.7.10
We finally ported the 'How To Videos' menu from to the SPA version of Enso.

To use it in an existing project do the following steps:
- `composer update`
- `composer require laravel-enso/how-to`
- `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=howToVideos-storage`
- `npm install --save vue-video-player`
- compile
- add in your `config/enso/config.php`, to the `paths` array the following entry: `'howToVideos' => 'howToVideos'`
- add in `storage/app/.gitignore` => `!howToVideos/`

## 2.7.9
- improves `laravel-enso/versioning` - read the updated documentation. It's a breaking change so be sure to update the code accordingly, and then in composer.json also update the require for `"laravel-enso/versioning": "1.1.*"`
- fixes a bug in auth.vue

## 2.7.8
- improves the mail templates
- adds to `config/enso/config.php` the following keys that are used for links in all the email notifications:
    - 'facebook' => ''
    - 'googleplus' => ''
    - 'twitter' => ''

To make use of the new templates in an existing project do the following steps:
    - publish the assets with `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=enso-mail-assets` (with `--force` if needed)
    - add the keys mentioned above to the `config/enso/config.php` file
    - update in `config/mail.php` the key `markdown.theme` from `default` to `enso`

## 2.7.7
- adds the ability to set a local state in the same request that builds Enso's state, by using the new config option `stateBuilder`. To use this feature point `stateBuilder` to a class that implements `LaravelEnso\Core\app\Contracts\StateBuilder` contract, and then make sure that you have the `resources/assets/js/localState.js` plugin, that should look like this:
    ```
    export default (context, state) => {
        // initalise the local state
    };
    ```
    where `state` is the what your local `StateBuilder` is returning.
- refactors `GuestController` by adding a `GuestState` Response
- adds the new laravel-enso/versioning package
- improves compatibility with PostgreSQL by renaming columns that are named with reserved words:
    - renames the "order" column to "order_index" in "menus" and "tutorials" tables
    - renames in "permissions" table the "default" column to "is_default"

Upgrade instructions:
- update `composer.json` to require `"laravel-enso/core": "2.8.*"`
- run `composer update`
- run `php artisan enso:db-rename-reserved` to update the database tables (`permissions`, `tutorials`, `menus`).

## 2.7.6

- fixes missing login redirect
- removes the obsolete created_by column in laravel-enso/contacts

For existing projects first update your `composer.json` to require:`"laravel-enso/contacts": "2.2.*"` and after updating run `php artisan enso:contacts:drop-created-by` to drop the fk/column.

## 2.7.5
- removes the created_by column in addressesmanager
- upgrades the share link modal for documents
- updates all composer / npm  packages

For existing projects first update your `composer.json` to require:`"laravel-enso/addressesmanager": "2.3.*"` and after updating run `php artisan enso:addresses:drop-created-by` to drop the fk/column.

## 2.7.4
