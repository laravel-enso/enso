be in-line with Raven Node implementation.\n *\n * HOWTO:\n *\n * import Raven from 'raven-js';\n *\n * const someAppReporter = new Raven.Client();\n * const someOtherAppReporter = new Raven.Client();\n *\n * someAppReporter.config('__DSN__', {\n *   ...config goes here\n * });\n *\n * someOtherAppReporter.config('__OTHER_DSN__', {\n *   ...config goes here\n * });\n *\n *

The `func` is invoked\n * with the last arguments provided to the debounced function. Subsequent\n * calls to the debounced function return the result of the last `func`\n * invocation.\n *\n * **Note:** If `leading` and `trailing` options are `true`, `func` is\n * invoked on the trailing edge of the timeout only if the debounced function\n * is invoked more than once during the `wait` timeout.\n *\n * If `wait` is `0` and `leading` is `false`, `func` invocation is deferred\n
