treated as a timestamp.\n *\n * If an argument is a string, the function tries to parse it.\n * Function accepts complete ISO 8601 formats as well as partial implementations.\n * ISO 8601: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601\n *\n * If the argument is null, it is treated as an invalid date.\n *\n * If all above fails, the function passes the given argument to Date constructor.\n *\n * **Note**: *all* Date arguments passed to any *date-fns* function is processed by `toDate`.\n * All *date-fns* functions will throw `RangeError` if `options.additionalDigits` is not 0, 1, 2 or
