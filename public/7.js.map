Key identifiers\n// are based on the strings that can appear in\n// [`KeyEvent.key`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key).\n// Use lowercase letters to refer to letter keys (or uppercase letters\n// if you want shift to be held). You may use `\"Space\"` as an alias\n// for the `\" \"` name.\n//\n// Modifiers can be given in any order. `Shift-` (or `s-`), `Alt-` (or\n// `a-`), `Ctrl-` (or `c-` or `Control-`) and `Cmd-` (or `m-` or\n// `Meta-`) are recognized. For characters that are created by holding\n// shift, the `Shift-` prefix is implied, and should not be added\n// explicitly.\n//\n// You can use `Mod-` as a shorthand for `Cmd-` on Mac and `Ctrl-` on\n// other platforms.\n//\n// You can add multiple keymap plugins to an editor.
