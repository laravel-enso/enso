Only meaningful\n//   if the node view also defines a `dom` property and if its node\n//   type is not a leaf node type. When this is present, ProseMirror\n//   will take care of rendering the node's children into it.

If the node view has a `contentDOM` property (or\n//   no `dom` property), updating its child nodes will be handled by\n//   ProseMirror.\n//\n//   selectNode:: ?()\n//   Can be used to override the way the node's selected status (as a\n//   node selection) is displayed.\n//\n//   deselectNode:: ?()\n//   When defining a `selectNode` method, you should also provide a\n//   `deselectNode` method to remove the effect again.\n//\n//   setSelection:: ?(anchor: number, head: number, root: dom.Document)\n//   This will be called to handle setting the selection inside the\n//   node. The `anchor` and `head` positions are relative to the start\n//   of the node. By default, a DOM selection will be created between\n//   the DOM positions corresponding to those positions, but if you\n//   override it you can do something else.\n//\n//   stopEvent:: ?(event: dom.Event) → bool\n//   Can be used to prevent the editor view from trying to handle some\n//   or all DOM events that bubble up from the node view.
